# Minetest Murder


### How do I play it? <br/><hr/>
When the match starts, a murderer is randomly selected, whereas other players are all cops. Who is who? Trust no one!

Murderer: use the knife to eliminate other players, supported by a kit of items to confound them. <br/>
Detective: your gun is the only thing that can stop the murderer, but beware: shooting another detective will result in eliminating both of you!

VICTORY CONDITIONS: <br/>
Murderer: kill all the players within the time limit.
Detectives: kill the murderer or survive until the end. 

<br/>

### Translations <br/><hr/>
You can translate the mod in your language by creating a file in the locale folder like this: `murder.LANGUAGE.tr`
and pasting in it the translation template that is in the file `template.txt` (beware **spaces matter**).
