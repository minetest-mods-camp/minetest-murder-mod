# Minetest Murder


### How do I play it? <br/><hr/>
3 or more players will spawn in a map (to be created via the `/murderadmin` command, use `/help murderadmin` to have more information), one of them will be the murderer, another one will be the cop and all the others will be the victims.
The goal of the cop is to kill the murderer, that of the murderer to kill everyone and that of the victims to survive.

The cop has a gun to shoot the killer with, a sprint serum, and a radar to check if the killer is nearby, but if he kills a victim he dies.
The killer has 2 gadgets, a knife and a finder chip, you can discover what they do by reading their descriptions.
The victim has the radar and the sprint serum.

### Translations <br/><hr/>

and pasting in it the translation template that is in the file `template.txt` (beware **spaces matter**).
