# Minetest Murder


### How do I play it?

The goal of the cop is to kill the murderer, the goal of the murderer to kill everyone, while as the victims, they simply have to survive. The cop has a gun to shoot the killer with, a sprint serum, and a radar to check if the killer is nearby; if the cop kills a victim, they are both eliminated. The killer has 2 gadgets: a knife and a finder chip. You can discover what they do by reading their descriptions. The victim has the radar and the sprint serum.
