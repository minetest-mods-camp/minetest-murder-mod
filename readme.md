# Minetest Murder

**How do I play it?** <br>
3 or more players will spawn in a map (to be created via the /murderadmin command), one of them will be the murderer, another one will be the cop and all the others 
will be the victims. The goal of the cop is to kill the murderer, that of the murderer to kill everyone and that of the victims to survive.
The cop has a gun to shoot the killer with, but if he kills a victim he dies.
The killer has 3 gadgets, a knife, a following chip and a sprint serum, you can discover what they do by reading their description.
